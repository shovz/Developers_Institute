          Irwin became involved with the park in a number of ways, including taking part in daily animal <br>
          feeding, as well as care and maintenance activities. On his sixth birthday, he was given a 4m scrub python.<br>
          He began handling crocodiles and even wrestled his first crocodile at the age of nine after<br>
          his father had educated him on reptiles from an early age.<br> <br> He worked as a volunteer for Queensland's East Coast
          Crocodile Management program and captured <br> over 100 crocodiles, some of which were
          relocated, while others were housed at the family park. Irwin took <br> over the management of
          the park in 1991 and renamed it to Australia Zoo in 1998

          The Crocodile Hunter became successful
          in the United States, the UK, and over 130 other countries,
          reaching<br> 500 million people. Irwin's exuberant and enthusiastic
          presenting style, broad Australian accent, signature<br> khaki
          shorts, and catchphrase 'Crikey!' became known worldwide.<br><br>

          Sir David Attenborough praised Irwin for introducing many to 
          the natural world, saying 'He taught them how wonderful and 
          exciting it was. He was a born communicator'

          The last Crocodile Hunter documentary
          spanned three hours with footage of Irwin's across-the-world
          adventure in locations including the Himalayas, the <br>Yangtze
          River, Borneo, and the Kruger National Park.

          After The Crocodile Hunter, Irwin went on to star in other Animal 
          Planet documentaries, including Croc Files, The Crocodile 
          Hunter Diaries and New Breed Vets. Animal Planet also 
          created the annual Croc Week marathon, which lasted a full week 
          in the middle of June, every year from 2000 to 2007.
