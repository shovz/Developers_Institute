                Irwin described his father Bob as a wildlife expert<br> 
                interested in herpetology, while his mother Lyn was<br> 
                a wildlife rehabilitator.After moving to Queensland,<br> 
                Bob and Lyn Irwin started the small <br>

          Irwin became involved with the park in a number of
          ways, including taking part in daily animal feeding,
          as well as care and maintenance activities.
          On his sixth birthday, he was given a 4m scrub python.
          He began handling crocodiles and even wrestled his 
          first crocodile  at the age of nine after his father
          had educated him on reptiles from an early age.
          He worked as a volunteer for Queensland's East Coast
          Crocodile Management program and captured over 100 
          crocodiles, some of which were relocated, while 
          others were housed at the family park. Irwin took
          over the management of the park in 1991 and renamed
          it to Australia Zoo in 1998
