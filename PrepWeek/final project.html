            <h1>Early Life</h1>
            <div class="right">
              <p>
                Stephen Robert Irwin was born on 22 February 1962<br>
                in Upper Ferntree Gully, Victoria, Australia.<br>
                He moved with his parents as a child to <br> 
                Queensland in 1970,where he attended Landsborough <br> 
                State School and Caloundra State High School.
              </p>
              <p>
                Irwin described his father Bob as a wildlife expert <br> 
                interested in herpetology, while his mother Lyn was a <br> 
                wildlife rehabilitator.After moving to Queensland, <br> 
                Bob and Lyn Irwin started the small <br>
                Queensland Reptile and Fauna Park, where Steve <br> 
                grew up around crocodiles and other reptiles.
              </p>
              <p>
                Irwin became involved with the park in a number of <br>
                ways, including taking part in daily animal feeding,
                as well as care and maintenance activities. <br>
                On his sixth birthday, he was given a 4m scrub python. <br>
                He began handling crocodiles and even wrestled his <br>
                first crocodile  at the age of nine after his father<br>
                 had educated him on reptiles from an early age.
              </p>
              <p>
                He worked as a volunteer for Queensland's East Coast<br>
                Crocodile Management program and captured over 100 <br>
                crocodiles, some of which were relocated, while <br>
                others were housed at the family park. Irwin took<br>
                over the management of the park in 1991 and renamed<br>
                it to Australia Zoo in 1998
